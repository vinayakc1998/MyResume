							<p>PUNE: The regional transport office (RTO) will soon grade driving schools in pune and pimpri chinchwad municipal limits based on a survey of the quality of services they offer.</p>
							<p>Senior RTO officials told TOI that the checking-cum-grading will help in ascertaining centres operating legally and illegally and enable driving centres to improve their services.</p>
							<p>"There will be three grades- A, B, C, where A stands for very good, B stands for good and C stands for satisfactory. Centres, which receive grade below C will not be allowed to function."Pune's deputy RTO sanjay sasane said.</p>
							<p>Both the Pune and pimpri chinchwad limits have around 200 driving schools registered with the RTOs. However, driving school sources said that there were around 200 more schools, which either had no proper infrastructure or existed just on paper. The transport department has provided us with parameters, which will be used to grade driving centres. These parameters include the number of cars a centre has, condition of the cars, kind of theretical training it imparts, do they have facilities like simulators, test track, classrooms, whether students are given lessons on basics vehicle maintenence, among others. While the RTO will not provide any special perks to the centres in A grade, they can advertise themselves with the certificate they get from the RTO, another RTO officil pointed out.</p>
							<p>Recently, driving schools had opposed a road transport ministry proposal allowing license seekers, who have passed out of an 'accredited' driving school. not having to appear for test for driving license. The issue of accredited driving schools had come up, but the requirements are so costly that it cannot be afforded by the majority. The RTO should try to identify driving schools operating illegally, the proprietor of a driving centre said. The road transport ministry had proposed last month that driving schools across the country will be provided with accreditation if they enhanced their facikities. These included setting up of test tracks over one acre of land, having latest equipment and simulators for the students etc. The ministry has opened the proposal for a public consultation for now.</p>

						<p><br>PUNE: The Regional Transport Office has sent notices to owners of 15-year-old
						vehicles to get then re-registerd and pay the green tax without delay.

						The The Regional Transport Office(RTO), Pune, has little information about 
						the number of such vehicles in its jurisdiction. The officials stated that a drive would start against such vehicles.

						"Those having such vehicles should immediatley check the documents and find out it the green tax has been paid. If not, it should be
						paid immediately and the vehicles should be re-registered", an RTO official said.</p>

						<p>"Vehicles would be checked on roads during the drive. If an old vehicle is found running without being re-registered or the green tax paid,
						it would br confiscated", the official said.

						The Union government recently announced a scrapping policy for old vehicles. More than 16 lakh vehicles could be scrapped
						in Maharashtra, the state transport department said. State transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne said while the transport department
						would be the single stop for the process, the respective RTOs would do the re-registering once anyone approached with an old vehicle.

						The RTO official said, "It is difficult to give a definite number of vehicles plying without re-registration. We shall have some idea after the drive starts," the official said.</p>

							<p>MUMBAI: The decision by the Union government to link adhaar cards with driving license and registration certificates (RC) of vehicles will bring down the number of visitors to various RTOs and also free them of agents/touts.A senior transport official said that there was a draft notification from centre on linking the driving license and RC with adhar card. 
							"If the adhar number of an applicant is linked with the license, the details will be uploaded on our sarathi portal.</p>
							<p>Similarly, for a new vehicle registration, the adhar details will be saved on the vahan portal. If the adhaar linkage is done, it will eliminate the need for visiting RTOs and for submitting documents. You can renew your license or make any other application from home," the officer said.
							Currently, people have to come to RTO offices and many end up paying a lot of money to agents/touts to get the work done. "The new system will not only kepp touts at bay, but will eliminate cases of forgery/making duplicate driving license." the officer said.
							Sources said that the RTOs expect a drop in visitors by 75% once the adhaar is linked to driving license and RC of vehicles.</p>

					<p>Ghaziabad: A token system has been lauched at the regional transport office for residents who want to update their vehicle-related records.
					Now, those who want to get duplicate copy of registration books and no objection certificates or update their addresses will have to apply on the state's transport department website.
					They can fill up online forms from their homes or the nearest public service centre and once the required fee is submitted, an applicant would be given a slot. The state transport officers will address the matter on the specified slot and complete the work in presence of the applicant.
					For the convinience of applicants, three slots have been fixed- 10am to noon, 12.30pm to 2.30pm and 3.30pm to 5pm.</p>
					Officials said that during a video conference held on november 6, the district magistrates were asked to conduct inspections of transport offices. Subsequently on saturday, Ghaziabad district magistrate ajay shankar pandey conducted an inspection and reviewed all online services that are being provided to applicants.
					Pandey asked officials to set up a separate room for those who violate traffic rules. In that room, a short flim on road safety would be shown to the offenders.
					"It will be mandatory for people to see the video. For this, instructions have been given to the assistant regional transport officers," he added.</p>
					<p>Due to lack of information about the online system, the transport office sees a crowd almost everyday from the time it opens at 10am.
					Officials have been asked to launched an awareness campaign to make people aware of the system so that most people can apply online and visit the office only on the specified slot.
					After spotting encroachments outside the transport office during the inspection, pandey instructed officials to ensure that the place is cleared within three days. He said, after that, surprise checks would be conducted from time to time.</p>

					<p>New Delhi: If you need to renew your driving license(DL) or get a duplicate one, get hypothecation of vehicle cancelled, transfer registration certificate (RC) or get an international driving permit, you will be able to do it from the comfort of your home, in all probability by next week.
					Delhi government has prepared a roadmap for revamp of its transport-related services, which as the government terms it, would become 'faceless' without any requirement the applicant's presence at the RTO. The government's transport department is starting ith 12 of its most 'sought-after' services and will gradually add most of its 70 services, including handling over RC of new vehicles at the vehicle dealership itself, Delhi's transport minister kailash gahlot told TOI.
					Delhi government is coming out with a major reform package under the leadership of chief minister arvind kejriwal, which would see almost all services of the transport department being made available to delhites in a 'faceless' manner from the comfort of their home, transport minister said.</p>
					<p>"Most of the services of the department are already available online but the reforms we are bringing in would see its final version, which would be completely faceless as you wouldn't have to come to RTO at all," the minister said.
					Gahlot said that he has directed the department to carry out intensive trials before the reforms are implemented so that there are no teething and people don't face any problem at all. "It is a good work that is being done and it should not be done in any haste," he said.</p>
					<p>Ashish kundra, principal secretary-cum-commissioner(transport), said that issuance of driving license, registration, permit, etc, are the cutting edge services of the department with a direct public interface. "The idea is to gradually switch over completely online in not only application but also processing and despatch of documents, and people should not be asked to come to the centre to get things processed," he said.
					Kundra said that the reform includes reorientation of people and some re-engineering of the system. "Once we have made sure our people and systems are ready, we will start with some pilot testing and then launched it. Technology is one part of the matrix and the other part is people who are actually dealing with these things," he said.
					KK Dahiya, special commissioner (transport) said that intensive trials and testing is going on to implement the reforms. "The second phase will include services related to commercial vehicles like permits, transfer, renewal, etc. By april, 58 more services are targeted to be made available online, " Dahiya said.</p>
